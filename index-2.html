  <h1>Land as Pedagogy: A Vocabulary Story</h1>

  <section>
    <h2><span class="term">Epistemology</span> â†’ <span class="indigenous-term">Nishnaabeg Ways of Knowing</span></h2>
    <p>In Leanne Simpson's story, knowledge is not passed down through lectures or tests but through direct, loving engagement with the land. Kwezens learns by watching, doing, feeling â€” not by being forced.</p>
    <blockquote>"Coming to know is learner-led and profoundly spiritual in nature." (Simpson 7)</blockquote>
    <p>This transforms the Western idea of epistemology into a whole-body, spirit-connected experience rooted in land and freedom.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2><span class="term">Platial Specificity</span> â†’ <span class="indigenous-term">Land as Teacher (Aki)</span></h2>
    <p>The sugar bush isn't just a setting â€” it's the teacher itself. Kwezens learns not only *on* the land, but *from* the land. Her knowledge of the maple tree comes from this platial intimacy.</p>
    <blockquote>"The land, aki, is both context and process." (Simpson 7)</blockquote>
    <p>Platial specificity means we can't detach learning from where we are â€” the land holds knowledge.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2><span class="term">Tribalography</span> â†’ <span class="indigenous-term">Story as Connection</span></h2>
    <p>Simpsonâ€™s narrative of Kwezens ties land, family, tradition, gender, and political resistance all into one story. It shows how Indigenous Story isnâ€™t just about the past â€” it holds the future too.</p>
    <blockquote>"Stories direct, inspire and affirm ancient codes of ethics." (Simpson 8)</blockquote>
    <p>This is tribalography in action â€” Story as theory, history, and roadmap for resurgence.</p>
