  <h1>Land as Pedagogy: A Vocabulary Story</h1>
  <div class="name">by Victor Orellana</div>

  <section>
    <h2><span class="term">Epistemology</span> → <span class="indigenous-term">Nishnaabeg Ways of Knowing</span></h2>
    <p>I used to think “epistemology” was just a fancy word for how people know things. But in this reading, I discovered that for the Nishnaabeg, it’s not just about ideas or logic — it’s about learning with your body, your heart, and your spirit. When Kwezens watches the squirrel and experiments for herself, she’s learning in a way that’s free, personal, and rooted in love. That’s not something we usually see in schools.</p>

    <h2><span class="term">Platial Specificity</span> → <span class="indigenous-term">Land as Teacher (Aki)</span></h2>
    <p>In this story, the land isn’t just the background — it’s the teacher. In the sugar bush, Kwezens isn’t taught through a lesson plan, but through being there and paying attention. That’s what I learned “platial specificity” means: you can’t separate learning from where it happens. The place itself — the land — is what makes the learning possible.</p>

    <h2><span class="term">Tribalography</span> → <span class="indigenous-term">Story as Connection</span></h2>
    <p>Kwezens’ story isn’t just about making maple syrup. It connects land, culture, gender, family, and resistance to colonialism. It’s a reminder of how important storytelling is in Indigenous cultures. It’s not just for entertainment — it’s how people pass on knowledge, survive, and build community. That’s tribalography in action.</p>
